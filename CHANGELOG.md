## [1.3.0] - 2025-11-27

### Unified Media Center & Audio Sync Improvements 🎵

#### 🎉 Added

- **Unified Media Center**
  - Combined Media Library and Media Manager into single tabbed interface
  - Three tabs: Library (Spotify/FPP sync), Audio Sync (sequence mapping), Local Files
  - Independent playlist selection per tab for better workflow
  - Consolidated navigation with single "Media Center" menu item

- **New Audio Sync APIs**
  - `/api/audio/playlist-status` - Get sequence status with audio file info from cached playlists
  - `/api/audio/download` - Download audio files directly from FPP with correct endpoint (`/api/file/music/`)
  - `/api/audio/mappings` - Manage sequence-to-audio file mappings
  - `/api/audio/local-files` - List and manage local audio files

- **Automatic Audio Mapping**
  - Downloads now auto-create mappings (sequence → audio file)
  - Reads `mediaName` directly from FPP playlist data for accurate downloads
  - No more 502/404 errors - uses correct FPP `/api/file/music/{filename}` endpoint

- **Manual Mapping UI**
  - "Map Audio" button for sequences needing manual linking
  - "Remap" button to change existing mappings
  - Dropdown selector shows all available local audio files
  - Shows FPP `mediaName` in yellow when available but not yet downloaded

#### 🔧 Changed

- Audio Sync tab no longer shows FPP sync/Spotify refresh banner (Library tab only)
- Improved status logic: sequences with `mediaName` show "needs-download", those without show "needs-mapping"
- Better error messages with URL details for debugging FPP connection issues

#### 🗑️ Removed

- Deleted separate `/app/admin/media/page.tsx` (merged into unified Media Center)
- Deleted `components/admin/MediaManager.tsx` (functionality integrated)

## [1.0.2-rc.1] - 2025-11-10

### Schedule-Aware Jukebox & Service Management Release

#### 🎉 Added

- **Schedule-Aware Jukebox**
  - New `/api/jukebox/schedule-status` endpoint detects active show times
  - Themed banners for off-season messaging (Christmas 🎄, Halloween 🎃, Default ⏰)
  - Countdown timer showing time until next show ("in 5h 30m", "in 15 minutes!")
  - Conditional rendering: hides requests/voting/queue when show is inactive (admins always see features)
  - Three-source active detection: schedule time windows, playing status, current playlist
  - Auto-refresh every 30 seconds to stay synchronized with FPP scheduler

- **Enhanced Service Management**
  - `install.sh` now starts both PM2 services: `fpp-control` (main app) + `fpp-poller` (background service)
  - Automatic PM2 installation if missing
  - Service verification checks both processes are online before completion
  - Helpful post-install commands displayed (pm2 logs, pm2 status, pm2 restart)

#### 🐛 Fixed

- **Schedule Detection**: Now correctly detects shows running via FPP scheduler (which doesn't set `current_playlist` field)
  - Parses schedule `startDate`/`endDate` ranges
  - Checks if current time is within `startTime` to `endTime` window
  - Handles day-of-week restrictions (e.g., only Monday/Wednesday)

- **Now Playing Display**: Fixed status not showing when cache is stale
  - Detects stale cache (>60 seconds old or status='unknown')
  - Automatically falls back to direct FPP API query
  - Prevents double returns with `usedCache` flag

- **Service Startup**: Fixed `install.sh` only starting `fpp-control`, missing `fpp-poller`
  - Now uses `pm2 start ecosystem.config.js` to start both services from configuration
  - Verifies both services are running before declaring success

#### 🔧 Changed

- Jukebox UI now dynamically shows/hides interactive features based on schedule
- Non-admin users see friendly off-season messages instead of broken UI
- Schedule check integrated with existing theme system for consistent styling
