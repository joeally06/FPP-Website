# Device Management CRUD System - Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

## Overview
Successfully implemented full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for the Device Monitor, allowing dynamic device management through the web UI without editing code files.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema ‚úÖ
**File**: `lib/database.ts`

Added new `devices` table to store device configurations:
```sql
CREATE TABLE devices (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  type TEXT CHECK(type IN ('fpp', 'falcon', 'projector')) NOT NULL,
  ip TEXT NOT NULL,
  enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT 1,
  description TEXT,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Prepared Statements Added:**
- `insertDevice` - Add new device
- `updateDevice` - Modify existing device
- `deleteDevice` - Remove device
- `getDeviceById` - Get single device
- `getAllDevices` - Get all devices
- `getEnabledDevices` - Get only enabled devices for monitoring

### 2. Device Migration ‚úÖ
**File**: `lib/migrate-devices.ts`

- Auto-migrates hardcoded devices from `device-config.ts` to database on first run
- Only runs migration if database is empty
- Logs migration progress to console
- Successfully migrated all 5 existing devices

**Console Output:**
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è [Device Migration] Database already has 5 devices, skipping migration
```

### 3. Device Management API ‚úÖ
**File**: `app/api/devices/manage/route.ts`

**Endpoints:**

#### `GET /api/devices/manage`
- Returns all devices from database
- Response: `{ success: true, devices: [...] }`

#### `POST /api/devices/manage`
- Creates new device
- Validates required fields (id, name, type, ip)
- Validates IP format (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)
- Validates device type (fpp, falcon, projector)
- Prevents duplicate IDs
- Response: `{ success: true, message: "Device created successfully", device: {...} }`

#### `PUT /api/devices/manage`
- Updates existing device
- Validates device exists
- Validates IP format
- Updates name, type, ip, enabled, description
- Response: `{ success: true, message: "Device updated successfully" }`

#### `DELETE /api/devices/manage?id=device-id`
- Deletes device by ID
- Validates device exists
- Response: `{ success: true, message: "Device deleted successfully" }`

### 4. Updated Device Check API ‚úÖ
**File**: `app/api/devices/check/route.ts`

- Now fetches devices from database using `getEnabledDevices()`
- Only checks enabled devices
- Logs check results for each device
- Returns device health status

**Changes:**
- Removed hardcoded import from `device-config.ts`
- Uses database as single source of truth
- Handles empty device list gracefully

### 5. Updated Device Status API ‚úÖ
**File**: `app/api/devices/status/route.ts`

- Fetches all devices from database
- Returns devices and their statuses
- Used by dashboard for real-time display

### 6. Enhanced Device Monitor UI ‚úÖ
**File**: `app/device-status/page.tsx`

**New Features:**

#### **Add Device Modal**
- ‚ûï "Add Device" button in header
- Form fields:
  - Device ID (auto-lowercase, auto-hyphenate spaces)
  - Device Name
  - Type (dropdown: FPP, Falcon, Projector)
  - IP Address (monospace font)
  - Description
  - Enable monitoring (checkbox)
- Validates and creates device via API
- Refreshes device list on success

#### **Edit Device Modal**
- ‚úèÔ∏è Edit button on each device card
- Pre-fills form with existing device data
- Device ID is read-only (cannot change)
- All other fields editable
- Updates device via API
- Refreshes device list on success

#### **Delete Device Modal**
- üóëÔ∏è Delete button on each device card
- Confirmation dialog with device details
- Shows device name, IP, and type
- Warning: "This action cannot be undone"
- Deletes device via API
- Refreshes device list on success

#### **Enhanced Device Cards**
- Shows both enabled and disabled devices
- Edit and Delete buttons in top-right corner
- Disabled devices shown with reduced opacity
- Status badge shows ONLINE/OFFLINE/DISABLED
- Supports devices with null descriptions

#### **Empty State**
- Shows helpful message when no devices configured
- "Add Your First Device" button to get started

### 7. Auto-Migration on Startup ‚úÖ
**File**: `app/layout.tsx`

Added migration import before device monitor:
```typescript
if (typeof window === 'undefined') {
  import('@/lib/migrate-devices');
  import('@/lib/santa-queue-processor');
  import('@/lib/device-monitor');
}
```

## How to Use

### **Add a New Device**

1. Navigate to `/device-status`
2. Click "‚ûï Add Device" button
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Device ID**: Unique identifier (e.g., `fpp-garage`)
   - **Device Name**: Display name (e.g., `Garage FPP Controller`)
   - **Type**: Select from dropdown (FPP, Falcon, Projector)
   - **IP Address**: Device IP (e.g., `192.168.5.10`)
   - **Description**: Optional description (e.g., `Controls garage lights`)
   - **Enable monitoring**: Check to start monitoring immediately
4. Click "Add Device"
5. Device appears in grid and monitoring starts automatically

### **Edit a Device**

1. Find device card on `/device-status` page
2. Click ‚úèÔ∏è (Edit) button in top-right corner
3. Update any field except Device ID
4. Change IP address if device moved
5. Toggle "Enable monitoring" to pause/resume checks
6. Click "Save Changes"
7. Device updates immediately

### **Delete a Device**

1. Find device card on `/device-status` page
2. Click üóëÔ∏è (Delete) button in top-right corner
3. Review device details in confirmation dialog
4. Click "Delete" to confirm
5. Device removed from monitoring and database

### **Disable/Enable Monitoring**

1. Click ‚úèÔ∏è (Edit) on device card
2. Uncheck "Enable monitoring" to pause checks
3. Device remains in database but won't be pinged
4. Re-check to resume monitoring

## Current Device Status

**Total Devices**: 5
**Online**: 4
**Offline**: 1

| Device | Type | IP | Status |
|--------|------|----|----|
| FPP Main Controller | fpp | 192.168.5.2 | ‚úÖ ONLINE |
| FPP Secondary | fpp | 192.168.5.5 | ‚ùå OFFLINE (11 failures) |
| Falcon F48 | falcon | 192.168.5.3 | ‚úÖ ONLINE |
| Falcon F16v3 | falcon | 192.168.5.4 | ‚úÖ ONLINE |
| Epson Projector | projector | 192.168.5.6 | ‚úÖ ONLINE |

## API Validation

All API endpoints include comprehensive validation:

### **IP Address Validation**
- Must match format: `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx`
- Regex: `/^(?:[0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}$/`

### **Device Type Validation**
- Must be one of: `fpp`, `falcon`, `projector`
- Enforced at database level with CHECK constraint

### **Device ID Validation**
- Must be unique
- Cannot create device with duplicate ID
- Returns 409 Conflict if ID exists

### **Required Fields**
- `id`, `name`, `type`, `ip` - all required for POST
- Returns 400 Bad Request if missing

## Database Migration

**Migration Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

The system automatically migrated all 5 hardcoded devices to the database:
- ‚úÖ FPP Main Controller
- ‚úÖ FPP Secondary
- ‚úÖ Falcon F48
- ‚úÖ Falcon F16v3
- ‚úÖ Epson Projector

**Migration Safety**:
- Only runs if database is empty
- Preserves all device settings (enabled, description, etc.)
- Logs each device migration
- Skips migration on subsequent server starts

## Benefits

### **Before** (Hardcoded Configuration)
‚ùå Had to edit `lib/device-config.ts` file
‚ùå Needed to restart server for changes
‚ùå Required code knowledge
‚ùå Risk of syntax errors
‚ùå No validation until runtime

### **After** (Database-Driven CRUD)
‚úÖ Add/edit/delete devices via web UI
‚úÖ Changes take effect on next monitor cycle (5 minutes)
‚úÖ No coding knowledge required
‚úÖ Real-time validation and error messages
‚úÖ Easy to temporarily disable devices
‚úÖ Audit trail (created_at, updated_at timestamps)

## Testing

**Recommended Tests:**

1. **Add Device Test**
   - Add device with valid data
   - Try adding duplicate ID (should fail with 409)
   - Try adding with invalid IP (should fail with 400)
   - Try adding with missing fields (should fail with 400)

2. **Edit Device Test**
   - Change IP address of existing device
   - Update description
   - Disable monitoring (should stop ping checks)
   - Re-enable monitoring (should resume checks)

3. **Delete Device Test**
   - Delete a device
   - Verify it's removed from monitoring
   - Check it's gone from database

4. **Monitor Integration Test**
   - Add new device
   - Wait 5 minutes for next monitor cycle
   - Verify device is checked
   - Verify status appears on dashboard

## Next Steps

**Optional Enhancements:**

1. **Bulk Operations**
   - Enable/disable all devices at once
   - Delete multiple devices with checkboxes

2. **Device Groups**
   - Organize devices by location or purpose
   - Group-based alerts

3. **Advanced Validation**
   - Ping IP address before adding to verify reachability
   - DNS lookup for hostnames

4. **Import/Export**
   - Export device list as JSON/CSV
   - Import devices from file

5. **Device History**
   - Track when IP addresses changed
   - Audit log of device modifications

6. **Custom Check Intervals**
   - Per-device check frequency
   - Priority devices checked more often

## Troubleshooting

### Device Not Monitoring
- Check "Enable monitoring" checkbox is checked
- Verify device appears in `/api/devices/status`
- Check server logs for monitor cycle

### Can't Add Device
- Ensure Device ID is unique (no spaces, lowercase)
- Verify IP address format is correct
- Check required fields are filled

### Changes Not Showing
- Wait up to 30 seconds for auto-refresh
- Click "Check Now" to force immediate refresh
- Check browser console for errors
